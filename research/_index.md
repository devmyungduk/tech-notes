## 2. Purpose
This repository is dedicated to the **study of internal structures and control logic of AI generative models**.  
Focus areas include:

- Analysis of Stable Diffusion and Flux-based conditioning flows.  
- Comparison of ControlNet, LoRA, and guidance algorithms.  
- Visualization of sampler behavior and latent processing workflows.
